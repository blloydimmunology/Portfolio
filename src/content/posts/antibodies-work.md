## Antibody Function

Antibodies are Y-shaped proteins that recognize and bind to specific antigens.

## Structure

The variable region determines what the antibody can bind to.

## Immune Protection

Antibodies neutralize pathogens and mark them for destruction.

## Applications

Understanding antibodies has led to many medical advances.
