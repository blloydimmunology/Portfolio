## What is Immunology?

Immunology is the study of the immune system - the complex network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to defend the body against harmful pathogens.

## Key Components

The immune system consists of several key components:

- **White Blood Cells**: The primary defenders against infection
- **Antibodies**: Proteins that recognize and neutralize foreign substances
- **Lymphatic System**: A network that transports immune cells

## How It Works

When a pathogen enters the body, the immune system responds through a coordinated series of events:

1. Recognition of the foreign invader
2. Activation of immune cells
3. Elimination of the threat
4. Development of immunological memory

## Conclusion

Understanding immunology is crucial for developing vaccines, treating autoimmune diseases, and improving overall health outcomes.
