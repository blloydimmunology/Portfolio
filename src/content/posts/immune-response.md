## Understanding Immune Response

The immune system has two main lines of defense: innate and adaptive immunity.

## Innate Immunity

First line of defense, rapid but non-specific response to pathogens.

## Adaptive Immunity

Slower but highly specific, creates memory for future encounters.

## Coordination

Both systems work together to protect the body from disease.
