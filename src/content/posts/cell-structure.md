## Cell Structure

Cells are the basic building blocks of all living organisms. Understanding their structure is crucial to understanding how life works.

## Key Components

- **Cell Membrane**: Controls what enters and exits
- **Nucleus**: Contains genetic material
- **Mitochondria**: Powerhouse of the cell
- **Ribosomes**: Protein synthesis

## Conclusion

Cell structure directly relates to cell function in maintaining life processes.
