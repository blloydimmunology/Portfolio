## The Vaccine Development Process

Modern vaccine development follows a rigorous process to ensure safety and efficacy.

## Stages of Development

### Preclinical Testing

Before human trials, vaccines undergo extensive laboratory testing to identify promising candidates.

### Clinical Trials

The clinical trial process consists of three phases:

- **Phase 1**: Small group testing for safety
- **Phase 2**: Expanded testing for efficacy
- **Phase 3**: Large-scale trials for confirmation

### Approval and Monitoring

After successful trials, regulatory agencies review the data before granting approval.

## Recent Advances

New technologies like mRNA vaccines have revolutionized the speed and flexibility of vaccine development.
