## The Heart's Structure

The heart is a muscular organ that pumps blood throughout the body.

## Four Chambers

- **Right Atrium**: Receives deoxygenated blood
- **Right Ventricle**: Pumps to lungs
- **Left Atrium**: Receives oxygenated blood
- **Left Ventricle**: Pumps to body

## Valves and Function

Valves ensure one-way blood flow through the chambers.
